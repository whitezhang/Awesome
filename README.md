RECORD THINGS THAT FUNNY

### Map Generator

Use the following command

> python mapgen.py

then we can obtain the random map as follow

<img src="./MapGen/base_map.png" alt="basic map" width="400px"/>

where `.` means floor, `W` means wall, `D` controls the place that can be passed, which can be replaced by `.`. Most important, the biggest can be regarded as the boss room.

That's AWESOME!

TODO: use this map to generate a really AWESOME map!
